#Ran the dockerfile CMD as an external script by creating a new script updating the Dockerfile

This one gave me a lot of issues. After 3 hours of trying different things it finally worked when I restarted my Gitpod Workspace. I really need to get better at documenting as I go because by the time I have success I've forgotten everything I have tried. This was my first experience using another branch as I did not want to interfere with main as it was working. Or so I thought. When I finally got fed up and almost to the point of giving up, I went back to main and ran docker compose up and I was getting the same error. I inspected the raw code from the webpage and found a CORS error. After searching "CORS" in discord someone had mentioned restarting their workspace. This did the trick and while I could kick myself for not first trying the age old question, "Did you reboot?" My first instinct as a System Administrator is to reboot, so why did I not consider that? Either way, I mostly learn from my mistakes so it was beneficial in the long run.

I cloned my repo from github to my local machine and when I tried docker compose up I was getting a react error but once I installed npm onto my local machine the front end was working.
I then changed my enviromnet varisables to:
```environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
      BACKEND_URL: "http://localhost:4567"
```
Im still unable to see the backend and still troubleshooting this:

After 2 days of troubleshooting I finally got it working on my local machine. I had issues with ```npm i``` and it was giving me react errors. I had to change ownership of the directory as it was created with root. I also had to delete the package-lock.json and once I was able to run ```npm i``` without sudo, it worked.
